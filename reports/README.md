# SRC folder

This folder contains a scaffold *report.qmd* file.  That is, I started the homework assignment
for you.

Your task is to clean up the *report.qmd* incrementally, making a few changes at a time and reviewing
the rendered results.

When you're done, render the document one last time and commit/push your changes to github.

For homework 1:

* You'll need to upload *report.html* to Canvas, and
* You'll need to post this repo to gradescope for autograding.

In this assignment,  the nine categories of data engineering tools, as well as three sub-categories, are described. To view the HTML page from the quarto file, please use the command "quarto render report.qmd" in the terminal. To view the HTML file, please open "report.html" in a web browser.

Yes , I have completed the assignment as per the instructions provided to the best of my ability.
